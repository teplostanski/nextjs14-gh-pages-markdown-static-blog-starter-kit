# Cinnamon Rolls

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 1 cup (240ml) warm milk (about 110째F or 45째C)
- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, melted
- 2 large eggs
- 4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt

### Filling

- 1 cup (200g) brown sugar, packed
- 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- 1/3 cup (75g) unsalted butter, softened

### Icing

- 1 cup (120g) powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the dough:** In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk. Add sugar, melted butter, eggs, flour, and salt. Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

2. **Make the filling:** In a small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon.

3. **Assemble the rolls:** Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a 16x21-inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Roll up the dough tightly and cut into 12 rolls.

4. **Bake:** Place the rolls in a greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise again until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C). Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.

5. **Prepare the icing:** In a small bowl, whisk together powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth.

6. **Finish:** Drizzle icing over warm cinnamon rolls before serving.

Enjoy your delicious homemade cinnamon rolls!
