# Warm yak meat stew

## Ingredients

- 600-800g beef, preferably with fat. I took a piece of the neck, but both the
  shoulder blade and the back will do;
- 2 leeks;
- 3 garlic cloves;
- 2 liters of water;
- 100 ml soy sauce;
- 200 grams of mushrooms, oyster mushrooms and champignons. Mushrooms, if
  desired, can be taken more, and they can be varied;
- salt and pepper to taste;
- spaghetti/fettuccine/funchosa at the rate of 100g per person;
- green onions;
- a hard-boiled or half-boiled egg.
