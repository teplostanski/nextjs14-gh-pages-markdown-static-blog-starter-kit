# Egg with herbs

## Ingredients

- 4 eggs;
- a pinch of fresh thyme, rosemary and parsley, if desired. I settled on thyme
  and rosemary, but with parsley it turns out delicious, do not ignore it;
- a pinch of salt and black pepper;
- 1-2 tbsp grated parmesan;
- 2 tbsp. l. heavy cream (30%) or just sour cream;
- 1 tbsp butter;
- good, delicious bread — one with the texture, smell of bread and with a soul.
  I came across a very decent ciabatta from the bakery, and it was cool. Bread
  is an important point here.

## Cooking method

In this recipe, everything is prepared quickly, you just need to prepare
everything and have it at hand at the right time.

1. Turn on the top grill in the oven and place the baking tray almost under the
   top;
2. Mix the parmesan, salt and pepper with finely chopped herbs;

4. Take suitable baking pans, add cream/sour cream and butter equally to them;
   place under the preheated top grill for 2-3 minutes so that the surface
   begins to bubble;

5. Quickly take out the molds and add eggs — two to each mold;

6. Sprinkle everything with a mixture of parmesan and herbs and return to the
   oven for another 3-5 minutes. As soon as the proteins tighten and stop being
   liquid, take them out;

7. While the eggs are baking, dry the bread in a heavy pan. Literally for a
   minute on each side over high heat, so that it is soft inside, but crispy
   outside. And make yourself a cup of coffee. It's morning after all.
