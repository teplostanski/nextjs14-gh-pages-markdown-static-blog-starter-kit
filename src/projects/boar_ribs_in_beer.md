# Boar ribs in beer

## Ingredients

- 1-1.5 kg of pork ribs. I had two 1.6 kilo tapes with a total weight of;
- 1 tbsp olive oil;
- 2 small onions or one medium;
- 2 cloves of garlic;
- 1 cup ketchup;
- 1 bottle of beer. After a series of failures, I chose a simple light beer for
  myself. Dark, with a bitter aftertaste and a complex taste, I do not like this
  sauce;
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce;
- 1/4 tsp chili (adjust the sharpness to taste);
- 3 tablespoons of honey. It is replaced with sugar or molasses;
- 1 tablespoon of apple or wine vinegar.

## Cooking method

1. Turn on the oven for 130 C;
2. If necessary, clean the ribs from excess films and rinse. Then blot out the
   moisture and season generously with salt and pepper;

3. Cover the baking sheet with foil or pour water into it;
4. Place the grill on top, and put the ribs on it with the meat side up. If
   there is no grill, the oven can also be in a baking dish, putting something
   under the bottom. But it's better with a grid. Both the texture and the
   overall look benefit;

5. Set the timer for 3 hours. The cooking has begun;
6. Heat the oil in a small saucepan or frying pan and add the finely chopped
   onion and garlic. Cook for 3-5 minutes over medium heat;

8. Cook over medium heat for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all
   this bacchanalia turns into sauce. Towards the end of cooking, it's not a bad
   idea to kill the whole thing with an immersion blender. It's a matter of
   seconds, but the sauce will win in the overall standings with a homogeneous
   structure and the absence of small pieces of onion and garlic. It's worth it.
   After that, return the sauce to the fire and cook a little more;

9. So, now it's important. Try the sauce. The taste should strive for a balance
   of sweet/sour/slightly spicy/spicy. It may be necessary to add honey/sugar;
10. Lubricate the ribs every 20-30 minutes without turning them over. You can
    lift the ribs a couple of times and lubricate the lower part;

11. My total time was about 3 hours and 15 minutes. I smeared it with icing and
    waited for everything to take hold. So, if it's greased and the time has
    come, wait;
12. Remove the ribs and let them cool down a little.
